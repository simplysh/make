# simple-make

No-fuss Makefile to use in small-scale C++ projects.

The goal is to produce a minimal, batteries-included Makefile which can compile successfully in Windows (MinGW), Linux, and Mac OS. 

It should also have built-in support for SDL2.

## Installing SDL2

### Windows

Download the development libraries from the [SDL2 home page](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php). They should be named something like `SDL2-devel-2.0.14-mingw.tar.gz`.

Extract and copy the contents into your local MinGW installation.
